Disease prediction by symptoms is a critical task in thefield of healthcare, as itenablesearly diagnosis and timely
treatment, improving patient outcomes. Machinelearning techniques haveemerged as valuabletools for analyzing
complex medical data and predicting diseases based on a patient'ssymptoms.In this project, weexplorethe application of
machinelearning algorithms to predict diseases solely using symptom information. The objective of this project isto
develop a symptom-based disease prediction system thatcan accurately classify patients into dif erent diseasecategories
based on theirreported symptoms.
